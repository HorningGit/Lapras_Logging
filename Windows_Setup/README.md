### Visual Studio Code
##### Installation
1. Download the Visual Studio Code installer for Windows.
2. Once it is downloaded, run the installer (VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe). This will only take a minute.
3. By default, VS Code is installed under C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code.
4. Alternatively, you can also download a Zip archive, extract it and run Code from there.

Tip: Setup will add Visual Studio Code to your %PATH%, so from the console you can type 'code .' to open VS Code on that folder. You will need to restart your console after the installation for the change to the %PATH% environmental variable to take effect.
